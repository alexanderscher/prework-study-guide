## Description

The Prework Study guide is a prework exercise for the UCLA coding bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to learn the fundementals of HMTL, CSS, Git and JS. This study guide lays out important information about each topic. During the process of building the study guide, I learned how to set up and style a webpage, use Github for saving and sharing code, and to use Javascript to create variables, for loops, if statements and functions.
